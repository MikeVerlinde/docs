## Problem analysis
In today's world, we all face an unprecedented deluge of information across multiple channels. We need to:

1. **Extract information** from our socials without getting distracted.
2. **Filter** out the noise to focus on our priorities.
3. **Summarize and process** the information to prepare for decision-making.
4. **Act** on our findings, usually within very short timeframes to not miss opportunities.

This comes with two categories of challenges. First, the information overload. It is very difficult to monitor all sources of information, not get overwhelmed, and remain productive on other tasks.

Second, the time constraints. A lot of opportunities are time-sensitive. Especially in crypto, where the best opportunites come and go within minutes, if not seconds. And when you're not there, such as overnight, the backlog quickly piles up.

## Solution
HyperFlow offers event-driven AI workflows to automate information processing, decision-making, and actions.

- **Events**: define on- and off-chain events to trigger your workflows, such as wallet tracking, Tweets or Telegram messages.
- **Decision-making**: define static and dynamic rules to represent the patterns of your thinking, such as logical statements, content extraction, or sentiment analysis.
- **Actions**: automatically execute any HyperOS action.
