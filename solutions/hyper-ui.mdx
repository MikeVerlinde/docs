title: HyperUI Framework
description: "Transform AI responses into rich, interactive interfaces with the standardized and optimized HyperUI framework."

## Problem analysis
While the current state of AI-powered interfaces is an improvement over traditional interfaces in many regards, it is also a massive step back in some key aspects. Over the past decades, systems have evolved from text-based interfaces to rich, interactive experiences optimized for their task. Many agentic applications take us back to the interface stone age.

This example illustrates how AI is successfully leveraged to make the retrieval of token information trivial, but fails to effectively communicate its findings back to the user.

## Solution
HyperUI is a framework that elevates any AI interaction into rich, interactive interfaces. This allows all types of agentic applications to leverage the best of both worlds, to actually provide a superior user experience.
