HyperFunctions revolutionizes the way language models interact with external functions, breaking through traditional API limitations. While current solutions cap function calling at around 20 functions, HyperFunctions enables your AI agents to seamlessly access thousands of functions through an intelligent RAG pipeline.

- **Unlimited Scale**: Deploy thousands of functions without performance degradation
- **Intelligent Routing**: Advanced RAG pipeline ensures precise function selection
- **Zero-Latency Access**: Lightning-fast function discovery and execution
- **Simple Integration**: Drop-in replacement for standard function calling
- **Cost Efficient**: Optimize token usage through smart function handling

Whether you're building a complex AI assistant or scaling your existing LLM applications, HyperFunctions provides the infrastructure needed to handle function calling at any scale.


## Approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
As the fundamentals of AI technology rapidly advance, so do the integrations into real-world applications. The AI ecosystem continues to expand with AI agents and frameworks building upon core capabilities. To understand the future of AI, we need to understand the concept of AGI and current technical challenges.

### Defining AGI

    <Tab title="Technical explanation">
    AGI is a hypothetical artificial intelligence that can match or exceed human intelligence across virtually any task. This is fundamentally different from the current state of AI, where models are trained on and thus limimted by a specific dataset represented as one type (e.g. text, matrix (grid-like), time-series, etc.).

### Approaching AGI
- One agent (one interface) capable of handling any task (via HyperFunctions Constellation and RichUI).


With rapid advancements in AI, it is more and more applied into the real world. It slowly becomes more useful with an ecosystem of tools, services, and frameworks built upon the fundamentals. With the recent developments of AI agents, LLMs are able to handle more and complexer tasks. Specialized agents are able to handle specific tasks, and with the help of tools, they are able to handle more complex tasks. HyperFunctions takes this one step further, approaching the concept of AGI. One AI system with one interface, capable of handling any task.
