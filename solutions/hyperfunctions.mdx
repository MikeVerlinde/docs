title: HyperFunctions
description: "HyperFunctions is the world’s first hybrid retrieval pipeline optimized for hyper-scalable function calling, allowing LLMs to approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)."

## Problem analysis
Function calling allows LLMs to interact with external services, largly increasing the capabilities and applicability of AI. Such applications are known as AI agents. Current agentic applications predominantly fragment their solutions across multiple agents, failing to address the fundamental problem of [scattered functionality](/solutions/hyper-os#problem-analysis-scattered-functionality). This fragmentation persists due to the technical constraints of function calling. Current solutions cap at around 20 functions per agent.
    
The current approach of using multiple agents to handle different tasks perpetuates the very problem it aims to solve: users must still navigate multiple interfaces and systems, merely replacing traditional app fragmentation with AI agent fragmentation.

## Solution
HyperFunctions is the world’s first hybrid retrieval pipeline, enabling any single AI agent to seamlessly access and integrate thousands of functions.
    - **Hyper-scalable**: Integrate thousands of functions in any single AI agent.
    - **Intelligent Routing**: Advanced hybrid retrieval pipeline ensures precise function selection, even at scale.
    - **Simple Integration**: Drop-in replacement for standard function calling

HyperFunctions provides the infrastructure needed to handle function calling at any scale.
